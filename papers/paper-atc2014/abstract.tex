\noindent{\bf Abstract.}  Email is a core communication mechanism for society.  
Current email protocols, like SMTP and IMAP, do not provide fundamental security 
properties like \emph{confidentiality}, \emph{integrity}, and \emph{authenticity}.  Users can optionally 
employ public-key cryptography like PGP on top of email, but the steps for doing 
so are too complicated for the average user. This paper presents Security-Transparent 
Email with Automatically-managed Keys (STEAK), a backwards-compatible email system 
that offers stronger security guarantees than SMTP while retaining most of the usability 
benefits of webmail.  Our main contribution is a key management protocol that 
performs key generation, distribution, and revocation securely and automatically. 
Like webmail, users can seamlessly access email from various devices.

For message exchange, unlike conventional email, STEAK uses a pull-based approach where senders 
host messages for receivers to download.  We exploit this to implement an ``unsend'' 
feature, as well as economically disincentivize spam. Our prototype implementation 
and a qualitative usability evaluation show that STEAK requires less workflow changes than
using PGP with email. Our preliminary performance evaluation 
shows that the system is responsive enough for typical use.
