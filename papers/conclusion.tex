\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented STEAK, a backwards-compatible email system that gives users 
webmail-like access semantics while providing message CIA guarantees.  It does so
by leveraging a user's cloud storage for hosting state, and by distributing and revoking
keys using more servers and channels than adversaries can compromise.  Our prototype
is under active development, but is qualitatively easier to use than PGP and does 
not hinder user-perceived performance.
